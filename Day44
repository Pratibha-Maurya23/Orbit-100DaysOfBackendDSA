## ☁️ Task 3 — AWS (Next Core Pillar)  
⏰ **Time:** 25–30 min  

📘 **Goal:**  
Move beyond EC2 basics and understand **how permissions actually work in AWS**.

### 🧩 What to Learn
- What is **IAM**  
- IAM **Users vs Roles**  
- Policies:
  - Managed policies  
  - Inline policies  
- Why IAM is **critical for security**

## 📘 Task 4 — DAA Unit 4 (Foundation Only Today)  
⏰ **Time:** 40–45 min  

📘 **Goal:**  
Build a **strong conceptual base** before solving numericals.

### 🧩 Study These Topics  
- Why **Dynamic Programming (DP)** is needed  
- Difference between:
  - Divide & Conquer  
  - Greedy  
  - Recursion  
  - Dynamic Programming  

### 📖 Focus Examples (Read + Understand Logic)
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)  
- 0/1 Knapsack (idea only)

📖 **Resource:**  
👉 Dynamic Programming Introduction – GFG

## 💜 Task 5 — Daily Discipline + English Practice  
⏰ **Time:** 10–15 min  

### ✅ Habits
- No series during study  
- Read **2 pages** of any book  
- Sleep by **11:30 PM**

### 🗣️ English Practice (2 min)
Say aloud:

> **“A bipartite graph can be colored using two colors such that no adjacent nodes share the same color.”**

✨ **Orbit Note:**  
Day 44 connects **interview-level DSA**, **exam-focused DAA**, and **real-world cloud security concepts**.  
This balance is exactly what strong SDE preparation looks like 🚀💜
