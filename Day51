# 💻 Day 51 — DSA + ML (Whole-Night Exam Revision Mode)

⏰ **Total Time:** Exam-focused day (flexible hours)

📘 **Main Goal:**  
- Keep **DSA consistency** alive  
- Revise the **entire ML syllabus** confidently for the exam  

---

## 🧮 Task 1 — DSA (Primary Task)  
⏰ **Time:** 30–40 min  

📘 **Goal:**  
Strengthen **greedy + interval scheduling** patterns (very common in interviews).

### 🧩 Problem to Solve  
**452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons**  
🔗 https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/

### 🧠 Concepts to Focus On  
- Interval overlap  
- Sorting by **end time**  
- Greedy decision making  

📖 **Resource:**  
👉 Interval Scheduling / Greedy – GFG  
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interval-scheduling-using-greedy-algorithm/

📝 **Quick Note (Important):**  
Write **2–3 lines** in your notebook:  
> Why sorting by end time is optimal  

(This helps a lot in interviews.)

- ID3 Algorithm  
- Overfitting  
- Advantages & disadvantages  

---

### 🔹 Unit 4 — Instance-Based Learning  
- k-NN algorithm  
- Distance metrics  
- Locally Weighted Regression  
- Case-based learning  

---

### 🔹 Unit 5 — Revision & Comparisons  
- SVM vs Decision Tree  
- k-NN pros / cons  
- Bias–Variance tradeoff
