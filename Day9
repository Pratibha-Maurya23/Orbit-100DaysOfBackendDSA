## 🧱 Task 1 — Backend: Environment Variables & Config Management  
⏰ **Time:** 40 min  

📘 **Goal:** Secure and organize your backend environment settings for production-ready apps.  

🧩 **What to Do:**  
- Create a `config/` folder and move your `.env` variables into it.  
- Learn how to use `dotenv` safely (`require('dotenv').config()` only once).  
- Use `process.env.PORT` and `process.env.MONGO_URL` instead of hard-coding.  
- Add a fallback default port when environment variables aren’t set.

## ☁️ Task 2 — AWS: Load Balancing + Scalability Basics  
⏰ **Time:** 45–60 min  

📘 **Goal:** Understand how AWS Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) distribute traffic across multiple servers.  

🧩 **What to Do:**  
- Read how **ELB** works (Application vs. Network Load Balancer).  
- Learn how to connect multiple **EC2 instances** behind one load balancer.  
- Study scaling concepts: **Auto-Scaling Groups**, **Health Checks**, **Target Groups**.  
- *(Optional Hands-On)* Simulate by launching **2 EC2s** with Node.js apps showing different “server IDs” in responses, then route via ELB.  

📖 **Resources:**  
- 👉 [AWS Elastic Load Balancing Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/what-is-load-balancing.html)  
- 👉 [Tutorial – Set Up Load Balancer Step by Step](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/)

## 🧮 Task 3 — DSA Lite: Binary Search Applications  
⏰ **Time:** 30 min  

📘 **Goal:** Strengthen applied binary-search problems that deal with search space reduction.  

🧩 **Problems to Solve:**  
- 🔹 [LeetCode: Capacity to Ship Packages Within D Days](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/)  
- 🔹 [LeetCode: Koko Eating Bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)

## 💬 Task 4 — English Speaking: Explaining Scalability Simply  
⏰ **Time:** 10 min  

📘 **Goal:** Learn to explain complex backend topics in fluent, simple English.  

🧩 **What to Do:**  
Speak (or record) a **1-minute explanation**:  
> “What is load balancing and why is it important for backend scalability?”  

Use connectors like:  
*“Basically,”*, *“In simple terms,”*, *“This ensures,”*, *“So that the server doesn’t crash when…”*
