## 🧮 Task 1 — DSA Core: Linked List Fundamentals  
⏰ **Time:** 40–45 min  

📘 **Goal:** Master Linked List creation, traversal, and key operations.  

🧩 **What to Do:**  
- Implement a **singly linked list** from scratch in Java.  
- Write functions for:  
  ➜ Insert at head  
  ➜ Insert at end  
  ➜ Delete by value  
  ➜ Reverse the list (iterative method)  
- Dry-run and print outputs step-by-step.

## 🧩 Task 2 — DSA: Recursion Practice (Core Logic)  
⏰ **Time:** 40 min  

📘 **Goal:** Strengthen recursive thinking and call-stack understanding.

## 🧱 Task 3 — Backend Mini Maintenance (Optional Refresh)  
⏰ **Time:** 25 min  

📘 **Goal:** Keep your backend structure neat and scalable.  

🧩 **What to Do:**  
- Refactor your **Express app structure** into separate folders:  
```
/routes
/controllers
/models
/config
```
- Use `module.exports` and `require()` cleanly for modular code organization.

## 💬 Task 4 — English Speaking: Explaining Recursion to a 10-Year-Old  
⏰ **Time:** 10–15 min  

📘 **Goal:** Improve clarity and simplify complex logic in your explanations.  

🧩 **What to Do:**  
Pretend you’re explaining recursion to a child — no technical jargon, just storytelling!  

🗣️ Start like this:  
> “Imagine you have a set of Russian dolls — each doll opens to reveal a smaller one inside…”  

Then connect it to recursion:  
> “Just like that, a recursive function keeps calling itself until it reaches the smallest doll — the base case!”
