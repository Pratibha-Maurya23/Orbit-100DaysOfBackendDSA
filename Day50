# 💻 Day 50 — DSA + ML Full Revision (Balanced Day)
⏰ **Total Time:** Whole-night (exam + concept-focused)

📘 **Main Goal:**  
Strengthen **greedy interval logic in DSA** and **consolidate ML Unit 1 → Unit 5** for exams and long-term understanding.

---

## 🧮 Task 1 — DSA (Primary Task): Greedy / Interval Scheduling  
⏰ **Time:** 40–45 min  

📘 **Goal:**  
Master **interval-based greedy problems**, very common in interviews.

### 🧩 Problem to Solve  
**435. Non-overlapping Intervals**  
🔗 https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/

### 🧠 Concepts to Focus On  
- Greedy choice  
- Sorting by **end time**  
- Why removing minimum intervals works  
- Relation to **Activity Selection Problem**

📖 **Resource:**  
👉 Interval Scheduling / Greedy – GFG  
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interval-scheduling-using-greedy-algorithm/

📝 **Tip:**  
Write down **why sorting by end time is optimal** — this explanation is frequently asked in interviews.

## 🤖 Task 2 — Machine Learning Revision (Unit 1 → Unit 5)  
⏰ **Time:** 1 hr – 1 hr 10 min  

📘 **Goal:**  
Revise all ML units **lightly but meaningfully** for exams + conceptual clarity.
