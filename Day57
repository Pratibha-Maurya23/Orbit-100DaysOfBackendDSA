# 💻 Day 57 — DSA + DAA Exam Day (Calm & Focused)

⏰ **Total Time:** Flexible (DAA paper priority)

📘 **Main Goal:**  
- Keep **DSA streak alive** with BFS  
- Perform confidently in **DAA paper**  
- Avoid burnout  

---

## 🧮 Task 1 — DSA (Primary Task): BFS / Shortest Path  
⏰ **Time:** 30–40 min  

📘 **Goal:**  
Strengthen **grid traversal using BFS** (very common in interviews).

### 🧩 Problem to Solve  
**1926. Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze**  
🔗 https://leetcode.com/problems/nearest-exit-from-entrance-in-maze/

### 🧠 Concepts to Focus On  
- BFS for shortest path in an unweighted grid  
- Queue usage  
- Direction vectors (up, down, left, right)  
- Visited marking to avoid cycles  

📖 **Resource:**  
👉 BFS in Grid – GFG  
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/breadth-first-search-or-bfs-for-a-graph/

📝 **Quick Note:**  
Write **2–3 lines** explaining:  
- Why BFS (not DFS) gives the nearest exit  
- What counts as a valid exit

## 📐 Task 2 — DAA Paper (FIRST PRIORITY)  
⏰ **Time:** As per exam schedule  

📘 **Goal:**  
Write **structured, confident answers**.

### 📝 Exam Writing Tips
- Start answers with **definition**  
- Write **steps / algorithm** clearly  
- Draw **DP tables / recursion trees**  
- Keep answers **clean & point-wise**
