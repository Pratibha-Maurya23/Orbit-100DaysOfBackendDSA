# 💻 Day 43 — DSA (Greedy + Heap) + AWS IAM + Graph Lecture 2 + HealHub Final Touches  
📅 **Date:** Day 43  
⏰ **Total Time:** ~3 hrs (split as per comfort)

📘 **Main Goal:**  
Advance interview-level DSA, learn the next AWS core pillar (**IAM**), strengthen Graph concepts, and wrap up remaining **HealHub user-side work**.

---

## 🧮 Task 1 — DSA (Primary Priority)  
⏰ **Time:** 1 hr 15 min  

📘 **Goal:**  
Strengthen **Greedy + Heap** patterns (very common in big-tech interviews).

---

### 🔹 Problems to Solve

#### 1️⃣ Maximum Subsequence Score  
🔗 https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subsequence-score/

**Concepts Used:**  
- Greedy strategy  
- Min Heap  
- Sorting + Heap combination  

---

#### 2️⃣ Total Cost to Hire K Workers  
🔗 https://leetcode.com/problems/total-cost-to-hire-k-workers/

**Concepts Used:**  
- Priority Queue  
- Two pointers + Heap  
- Cost optimization  

📖 **Resource:**  
👉 Heap / Priority Queue – GFG  
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/priority-queue-set-1-introduction/

📝 **Interview Tip:**  
After solving each problem, write **2–3 lines** explaining *why heap was required*.

## ☁️ Task 2 — AWS Core: IAM (Very Important)  
⏰ **Time:** 30–35 min  

📘 **Goal:**  
Understand **IAM**, the foundation of AWS security.

---

### 🧩 What to Learn
- What is **IAM**?  
- IAM **Users vs Roles**  
- **Policies** (JSON-based permissions)  
- Why IAM is required before using EC2, S3, etc.

🧠 **Think Like This:**  
- **User** → Human  
- **Role** → Service (EC2, Lambda)  
- **Policy** → Permission rulebook

## 🌐 Task 3 — Graph Learning (Lecture 2)  
⏰ **Time:** 25–30 min  

📘 **Goal:**  
Strengthen graph fundamentals.

---

### 🧩 What to Cover
- Graph representations:  
  - Adjacency List  
  - Adjacency Matrix  
- BFS vs DFS (when to use which)  
- Real-life examples (maps, networks)

📖 **Resource:**  
👉 Graph Representation – GFG

---

## 🧱 Task 4 — Project: HealHub (Final User-Side Work)  
⏰ **Time:** 30–40 min  

📘 **Goal:**  
Bring **HealHub** closer to a usable system.

---

### 🧩 What to Do
- Complete **User Page UI**  
- Ensure APIs are connected:  
  - Add Medicine ✅  
  - Edit Medicine ✅  
  - Delete Medicine ✅  

🧪 **Test Full Flow:**  
- User login → view medicines  
- Pharmacist manages medicines
